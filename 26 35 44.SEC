<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification has been specifically limited to cover the requirements 
for <SCP>the procurement, installation, and testing of 72 kW, 270 VDC solid state 
converters</SCP>.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For Navy projects, the use of any other size converter is no longer authorized.  
If a different size unit is required for a specific project, contact NAVFAC 
Atlantic (LANT), Code DC 44 - Electrical Criteria Manager at (757) 322-4327 
for authorization, and for the additional requirements necessary to appropriately 
modify this specification.</NPR><BRK/>

Standard when editing this guide specification or preparing new project specification 
sections.  Edit this guide specification for project specific requirements by 
adding, deleting, or revising text.  For bracketed items, choose applicable 
item(s) or insert appropriate information.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Remove information and requirements not required in respective project, whether 
or not brackets are present.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Comments, suggestions and recommended changes for this guide specification are

<NPR>NOTE:  These converters are used to supply 270 VDC and limited amounts of 28 
VDC electrical power to aircraft in shore facility environments.  Typical applications 
include aircraft operating in flight line conditions or in hangars, avionics 
shops, laboratories, training buildings, flight simulators, and computer rooms.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This specification is not to be used for procurement of power converters installed 
on board aircraft or ships without specific authorization from Naval Air Warfare 
Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD Power and Energy Division (AB43) at (301) 342-4161), 
and from the Naval Sea Warfare Command (contact the Technical Warrant Officer 
for the appropriate ship classification).</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This specification is not intended for medium-voltage applications.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  For Navy projects, incorporate the special SUBMITTAL REVIEW PROCESS paragraph 
in the SUBMITTALS section.  Coordinate with NAVAIR, NAVFAC, and the Activity 
to see whether the "review and approval", or the "surveillance only" options 
are required.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>1)  If "review and approval" (reach-back support) is desired, for a specific 
NAVFAC project, the technical representative (electrical engineer) editing this 
document for that project must contact NAVFAC LANT for consultation during the 
design stage of the project, prior to including the requirement in the specification.  
Point of Contact (POC) information is included in the first introductory technical 
note.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>2)  If "surveillance only" is agreed to, it requires the submittal information 
to be sent to NAVAIR and NAVFAC LANT for review and comment at the same time 
as the information is being sent to the Designer of Record for Review and Approval.  
The surveillance mode would give NAVAIR or NAVFAC LANT the opportunity to confirm 
compliance, without inadvertently holding up the project if the appropriate 
personnel are not available to do the review in a timely manner.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Electrical Designer of Record must also insure that the Division 1, Section 
<SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES, paragraphs FORWARDING SUBMITTALS REQUIRING GOVERNMENT 
APPROVAL and SUBMITTALS RESERVED FOR NAVFAC [_____] APPROVAL of the project 
document are edited to identify the agreed upon special process.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Coordination is required between this section and the project power systems 
study to determine which of the standardized Arc Flash Warning labels are required 
on the equipment.  These labels (Graphics) are available in metric (SI) and 
U.S. Customary (IP) system dimensions.  Use these files to develop project specific drawings.<BRK/>

the load end of the cable.  Verify converter is operating within specified regulation limits at each load level 
by overlaying the graph of Figure 263544 - 1 with the 270 VDC test data, and Figure 263544 - 2 with the 28 VDC 
test data.  In addition, verify specified performance of the line drop compensation.</TXT><BRK/>
