<NPR>NOTE:  Cathodic Protection should be installed on those portions of the gates submerged at normal pool levels.  
The faces of the gates should be protected to upper pool stages, except that the downstream face of the lower 
gates must be protected to the lower pool level.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This guide specification includes the technical requirements for the types of equipment normally provided in a 
cathodic protection system, and is based upon the premise that the system is designed by a qualified engineering 
firm hired by the Government to provide a complete cathodic protection system design, including detailed specifications 
(which contain performance criteria) and drawings which the successful Contractor can then use to construct the 
system.  The engineering firm must provide the design services of a Corrosion Expert(s) to design, supervise, 
and inspect system installation and test, energize, and adjust the completed system installation.  The Corrosion 
Expert is a person, who by reason of thorough knowledge of the physical sciences and the principles of engineering 
and mathematics, acquired by professional education and related practical experience, is qualified to engage in 
the practice of corrosion control of Lock &amp; Dam Miter and Tainter Gates and other submerged metallic appurtenances.  
Such person(s) must be accredited or certified by NACE International (formerly the National Association of Corrosion 
Engineers) as a Corrosion or Cathodic Protection (CP) Specialist or be a register professional engineer who has 
certification or licensing that includes education and experience in corrosion control of Lock &amp; Dam Miter 
and Tainter Gates and other submerged metallic appurtenances.  The names and qualifications of the Corrosion Expert(s) 
must be certified and submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer prior to the start of the cathodic protection 
system design.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>It is the intent of these guide specification to require the Contractor to design, furnish, install, test and 
place into service the complete cathodic protection system for the lock miter gates.  The system is to consist 
of all equipment, wiring, and wiring devices necessary to produce a continuous flow of direct current from the 
anodes in the water electrolyte to the gate surfaces to adequately and efficiently protect the surfaces of the 
metal structures against corrosion where the surfaces are in contact with the water.  The metallic surfaces of 
the gates need only be protected to upper pool stages, except that the downstream side of the lower gate shall 
be protected to lower pool level.  This is in addition to the protective coating on the gates.  The Contractor 
will provide, prior to system installation, detailed design calculations, bill of materials lists and drawings 
of the cathodic protection system.  The drawings will detail the system installation including arrangement and 
locations of all anodes, terminal boxes, conduit routing and test facilities to be installed for corrosion control 
on the submerged surfaces of the gates.  The Contractor furnished materials list, design calculations and drawings 
must be approved by the Contracting Officer prior to purchasing, delivering or installing any of the cathodic 
protection system.  These specifications together with the approved materials list, design calculations and drawings 
provide the minimum requirements of this contract.  The cathodic protection system will be furnished complete 
and in operating condition as further defined later in this specification.</NPR><BRK/>

<BRK/>
<TXT>Final test and adjust the system such that the cathodic protection system is providing corrosion control for the submerged surfaces of the lock 
miter gates in accordance with the following paragraphs taken from Section 6 of <RID>NACE SP0169</RID>.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>First Criterion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>A negative (cathodic) voltage of at least a minus 850 millivolts "instant-off" potential, as measured with respect to a calibrated, saturated copper-copper 
sulfate reference electrode (CSE) over 90 percent of each gate leaf face, and at least minus 800 millivolts "instant-off" at all other locations.  
These requirements do not necessarily include those areas within<MET> 0.61 m</MET><ENG> 2 ft</ENG> of the sill, quoin and miter of each gate (refer to Paragraph 1.3.3.2 
of <RID>NACE SP0169</RID>).  The above criteria shall be achieved without the "instant-off" potential exceeding minus 1100 millivolts at any location.  Determination 
of this voltage shall be made with the cathodic protection system in operation.  Correction shall be made for IR drop using "instant-off" potential 
measurements (all operating cathodic protection systems shall be simultaneously interrupted).  If digital meters are used to obtain these measurements, 
the second reading displayed on the digital voltmeter after interruption of the rectifier current shall be interpreted as the "instant-off" reading.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Second Criterion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>A second criterion may be used for those gate submerged surfaces within<MET> 0.61 m</MET><ENG> 2 ft</ENG> of each gate sill, quoin, and miter to ensure that the operating 
conditions are providing cathodic protection.  This criterion is a minimum cathodic polarization voltage decay of 100 millivolts provided that 
a potential of at least minus 750 millivolts "instant-off" potential as measured with respect to a calibrated, saturated copper-copper sulfate 
reference electrode (CSE) is also obtained.  Polarization shift measurements shall be made within<MET> 0.305 m</MET><ENG> 1 ft</ENG> of the sill plate at the quoin, 
at<MET> 0.61 m</MET><ENG> 2 ft</ENG> intervals along the gate bottom, and at the miter on each gate leaf face.  This criterion cannot be used until the criterion in 
paragraph 1.3.3.1 of <RID>NACE SP0169</RID> for the remaining gate submerged surfaces have been maintained for a minimum 1-week period.  This allows time 
for the cathodic protection system to polarize the gate metal.  The "instant-off" potential shall be measured between the structure surface and 
a saturated copper-copper sulfate reference cell immersed in the electrolyte directly adjacent to the structure.  Interrupting the protective current 
and measuring the polarization decay thereafter shall determine this polarization voltage shift.  When the protective current is initially interrupted, 
an immediate voltage shift will occur.  The second voltage reading observed after the immediate voltage shift shall be recorded and used as the 
base reading from which to measure polarization decay.  Readings shall then be taken each 10 minutes thereafter and the voltage readings and time 
intervals recorded.  The total time for achieving this decay shall be 4 hours or less.</TXT><BRK/>

a.  Cost-effective in high current ratings.<BRK/>
b.  More efficient in higher voltage ratings.<BRK/>

a.  Must be surge protected with selenium.<BRK/>
b.  Cannot withstand extreme surges.<BRK/>

Selenium stacks (cells): These stacks may be more economical in lower voltage output circuits where current requirements

a.  Can withstand surges caused by lightning much better than silicon without additional protecting devices.<BRK/>
b.  Are cost-effective in lower voltage and lower current ratings.<BRK/>
c.  Can withstand severe short-term overloads<BRK/>
