<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification covers the requirements for <SCP>static UPS to provide continuous ac power to critical 
loads and/or to improve the quality of ac power to critical loads.  The specification is intended to cover three-phase 
systems starting with the smallest unit at 20 kVA.  The upper end for a single module is around 750 kVA; however, 
parallel systems can have a larger total output.   This guide specification is intended to be used with individual 
UPS units which contain a single module, parallel systems of the same size module, and scalable modular UPS systems.  
Single phase systems are not addressed.  This specification covers UPS with electro-chemical batteries. Electro-mechanical 
(stored energy) UPS are not addressed.</SCP>  White paper TSEWG TP-19 is on Static Uninterruptible Power Supplies and 
should be reviewed while editing this specification.  See <URL HREF="https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/dod/supplemental-technical-criteria/tsewg-tp-19">https://www.wbdg.org/ffc/dod/supplemental-technical-criteria/tsewg-tp-19 </URL>
 This specification supercedes previous versions of UFGS-26 32 33.00 10 Static Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) 
and UFGS-26 33 53.00 20 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).<BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Scalable units are rack or cabinet mounted UPS power modules of the same size, which have scalable architecture 
to allow expansion/contraction to a different kVA size within the same vertical rack or cabinet lineup.  The kVA 
is achieved by adding or subtracting power modules to achieve the desired kVA rating.  Each power module, depending 
on the manufacturer, has a rectifier, inverter and battery converter.  There is an UPS system module that works 
with these power modules to form the UPS.  Scalable Units can be specified to have be non-redundant or be redundant.

<NPR>NOTE:  Ventilation of storage battery areas is required by NFPA 70.  A safe environment for such areas exists 
where the concentration of gaseous hydrogen does not exceed 2 percent accumulation per unit volume.  Factors used 
to determine this condition are the size and type of battery to be charged; room volume; maximum volume of hydrogen 
gas emitted during charging; and ventilation rate.  Approximately 0.016 cubic foot per hour of hydrogen gas is 
produced from each fully charged wet cell per charging ampere.  Valve-regulated cells typically produce considerably 
less.  Once sufficient ventilation is produced, no need exists for explosion-proof wiring, vapor-proof fixtures, 
or other special provisions.  Mechanical ventilation (an exhaust fan) should be provided in accordance with the 
battery manufacturer's recommendations.<BRK/>
<BRK/>
Battery Room Temperature.  Battery system performance may be affected by battery room temperatures above or below 
the nominal range of 23 degrees C (74 deg. F) to 27 degrees C (80 deg. F). Battery capacity is reduced at lower 
temperatures and battery life expectancy is reduced at sustained temperatures greater than 30 degrees C (86 deg. 
F). Batteries should be derated if battery room temperatures are expected to vary more than plus or minus 2 degrees 
from the standard 25 degrees C.</NPR><BRK/>

<NTE><AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Refer to UFC 3-520-01, "Interior Electrical System"s for battery types and selection information.  UPS 
systems either use two basic types:  wet cell (also called flooded cell) or valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA).  
There are two types of VRLA:  gel and absorbed glass mat(AGM).  Provide AGM type for UPS applications when choosing

<SPT><TTL>General</TTL><BRK/>
<NTE><AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries are predominately lead calcium and should be chosen for most 
applications. VRLA batteries that are pure lead have longer life when compared to lead calcium.  If considering 
pure lead, a cost analysis should be performed.  Wet cells can be lead calcium, lead antimony or lead selenium 
with lead calcium the most common.  Lead antimony  and lead selenium are better for deep cycle applications and 
should only be considered in areas where there are very frequent power outages e.g. in areas where the battery 
is normally on a stand-by do not use lead antimony or lead selenium. Lead selenium, or sometimes called low antimony 
batteries, have a higher cycle capability when compared to lead calcium (5+ times), but not as good a lead antimony 
batteries (about 70%).  Note that lead selenium typically requires less maintenance when compared with lead antimony.  
If designer wants lead antimony or lead selenium, the choice needs to be added to the wet cell paragraph.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<NTE><AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Wet cell batteries require a dedicated room.  Small UPS units will typically use the valve-regulated lead-acid 
type battery.  Wet cells can last up to 20 years with proper maintenance.  There are two "grades" of VRLA: one 
for 10 years and one for 20 years.   Note that 10 yr batteries typically only get 5-6 years of life in UPS application.  
If a 20 year VRLA is desired, then a life cycle cost analysis should be performed since the cost can be significantly 
more than a 10 year VRLA.   Refer to UFC 3-520-05, "Stationary Battery Areas" for guidance governing the architectural, 
mechanical, plumbing and electrical requirements for design of stationary secondary battery installations.</NPR><BRK/>
