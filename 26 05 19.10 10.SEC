<BRK/>
<NPR>In making wiring layouts for those installations using multiple-conductor cables, care should be taken to avoid 
the use of assemblies not normally stocked by manufacturers, or of small quantities which will not come within 
the manufacturers' minimum pricing schedules.  In general, unless very large quantities are involved, lower overall 
cable costs can be effected by using manufacturers' standard assemblies, even though more conductors than required 
are provided, instead of a cable requiring a special setup.  Short lengths may be eliminated by substituting cables 
which will have sufficient quantity to obtain the manufacturers' minimum price.  Substitution may consist of a 
larger number of conductors than required, or a combination of assemblies of a smaller number of conductors.  
The most economical cable schedule for any particular installation can be obtained only by careful study of all 
factors involved, particularly increased conduit costs.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE: If aluminum is to be specified for any of the wire purchased, revise the paragraphs accordingly. <BRK/>
<BRK/>
Conductors for wire and cable may be aluminum or copper. Aluminum conductors may be considered for use in accordance 
with NFPA 70, Article 310.106.  When used, aluminum conductor material must be AA-8000 series electrical grade 
aluminum alloy.  The designer must consider several factors when deciding to use aluminum instead of copper including 
comparisons of electrical properties, mechanical properties, environmental properties specific to the intended 
installation, reliability, and cost.  Specifications for wire and cable may be written to permit either aluminum 
or copper conductors where aluminum is suitable for the application, suitably reliable, and is determined to be 
more economical than copper. <BRK/>
<BRK/>
Aluminum conductors should be permitted only where cost comparisons show an overall savings and after a careful 
evaluation of the corrosion problems<BRK/>
associated with their use. They should only be allowed where installers are qualified to make reliable connections 
with them. Proper wire and cable connectors must be suitably rated for installation with the conductor material 
to which they are applied. Wire and cable connectors used with aluminum conductors must be suitably rated, termination 
must be prepared correctly, and an antioxidant must be applied when the connector is installed. Costs should be 
compared to between all pertinent items such as installation, conduit, tray, tunnel and duct banks, lifetime costs 
of energy losses if significant, and differences in ventilation needs if losses are evaluated. Conductors should 
have the required current carrying capacities, the required short circuit capacities, and should be satisfactory 
with respect to voltage drop. Aluminum conductors should be sized to have equal or less resistance than the alternate 
copper conductors unless the total cost comparison, including losses, shows a net advantage otherwise. In such 
cases where the engineering costs to properly compare the use of the two materials will exceed any possible savings 
to be<BRK/>
achieved by aluminum, the arbitrary choice of copper may be the best policy.</NPR><BRK/>

criteria or an industry standard that the cable or conductor must meet. For projects which require multiple types 
of insulations, indicate the type for each cable on the project drawings. <BRK/>
<BRK/>
The insulation compounds specified herein are of the thermoplastic and thermosetting type. Thermoplastic insulation 
types such as THHN, THWN, and THWN-2 must meet the requirements of UL 83 and is typical for circuit voltage ratings 
of 600 volts.  Thermosetting insulation type options include cross-linked thermosetting polyethylene (XLPE) and 
ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) which must meet the requirements of UL 44. These two materials alone are widely 
available and can be satisfactorily compounded to meet the requirements of a conservative cable design for long 
and reliable service. Cross-linked thermosetting polyethylene insulation types include XHHW and RHW. XHHW type 
insulation provides good thermal expansion and contraction characteristics applicable for power and control conductors 
with circuit voltage ratings of 2,000 volts or less in installations exposed to large temperature changes or installed 
outdoors subject to weather cycles from hot summer to cold winter temperatures.  XLPE is applicable for all circuit 
voltage ratings.  EPR is applicable to wire and cable for circuit voltages rated greater than 2,000 volts.  The 
insulation grades permitted must be suitable for service in wet or dry locations at 90 C. This specification does 
not allow the use of "tray cable" meeting only the minimum requirements of the National Electrical Code or Underwriters 
Laboratories, which permit a 75 C wet rating. Jackets are also thermosetting, except certain thermoplastic compounds 
are permitted for use below 601 volts, as defined in paragraph JACKET MATERIAL, subparagraph ACCESSIBLE USE ONLY,

<NPR>NOTE:  The rated circuit voltage of the insulation should be specified to be 600 volts for all circuits operating 
below 601 volts.  Higher rated circuit voltages may be required by some applications within this range, such as 
control circuits containing large dc solenoids used in older circuit breakers.  Specifications should then be 
revised to require 1,000- or 2,000-volt insulation in such cases for multiple- or single-conductor cables, respectively.  
Below 48 volts, 600-volt insulation can be used, but these are special applications that are best considered in 
light of the particular circumstances.  For example, many proprietary detection systems and programmable controller 
applications typically use 24-volt, low-power circuits, for which lower rated circuit voltages may be appropriate.  
These specifications also cover rated circuit voltages for systems operating above 600 volts.</NPR><BRK/>
