<STL>400-HERTZ (HZ) SOLID STATE FREQUENCY CONVERTER</STL><BRK/>
<DTE>08/21</DTE><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification covers the requirements for <SCP>the procurement, 
installation, and testing of 400 Hz solid state frequency converters</SCP>.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>1)  Combination converters (having both "400 Hz and 28 VDC" power outputs) are 
no longer permitted on Navy projects.  When a combination converter is required 
for a specific Army project, edit the title of the specification to "COMBINATION 
400 HERTZ AND 28 VDC SOLID STATE CONVERTER", and select the appropriate bracketed 
options throughout the remainder of the specification.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>2)  Previous versions of this specification referred to equipment sized only 
in kVA at 0.8 lagging power factor.  The specification now has the requirement 
to use kW instead of kVA as the unit of power measurement for converters here 
and on the project drawings.  This is a significant change in equipment designation, 
intending to ensure that our equipment meets the full required load range, including 
full power at unity power factor.  It has been made to eliminate the problems 
that have been occurring with existing equipment in the field, and to accommodate 
the increasing nonlinear load characteristics of Military equipment.  NAVAIR 
documents, including their Facilities Requirements Documents (FRD)s, are being 
revised to coordinate with this change to kW.  Army documents are in the review 
process.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  These converters are used to supply 400 Hz electrical power to aircraft 
and ships in shore facility environments.  Typical applications include aircraft 
operating in flight line conditions or in hangars, avionics shops, laboratories, 
training buildings, flight simulators, and computer rooms.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>This specification is not to be used for procurement of power converters installed 
on board aircraft or ships without specific authorization from Naval Air Warfare 
Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD Power and Energy Division (AB43) at (301) 342-4161), 
and from the Naval Sea Warfare Command (contact the Technical Warrant Officer 
for the appropriate ship classification).</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>This specification is not intended for medium-voltage applications.</NPR><BRK/>

<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  For Navy projects, incorporate the special SUBMITTAL REVIEW PROCESS paragraph 
in the SUBMITTALS section.  Coordinate with NAVAIR, NAVFAC, and the Activity 
to see whether the "review and approval", or the "surveillance only" options 
are required.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>1)  If "review and approval" (reach-back support) is desired, for a specific 
NAVFAC project, the technical representative (electrical engineer) editing this 
document for that project must contact the NAVFAC Atlantic (LANT), Code DC 44 
- Electrical Criteria Manager at (757) 322-4327 for consultation during the 
design stage of the project, prior to including the requirement in the specification.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>2)  If "surveillance only" is agreed to, it requires the submittal information 
to be sent to NAVAIR and NAVFAC LANT for review and comment at the same time 
as the information is being sent to the Designer of Record for Review and Approval.  
The surveillance mode would give NAVAIR or NAVFAC LANT the opportunity to confirm 
compliance, without inadvertently holding up the project if the appropriate 
personnel are not available to do the review in a timely manner.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The Electrical Designer of Record must also insure that the Division 1, Section 
<SRF>01 33 00</SRF> SUBMITTAL PROCEDURES, paragraphs FORWARDING SUBMITTALS REQUIRING GOVERNMENT 
APPROVAL and SUBMITTALS RESERVED FOR NAVFAC [_____] APPROVAL of the project 
document are edited to identify the agreed upon special process.</NPR> <BRK/>
