<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  This guide specification covers the requirements for <SCP>three-phase pad-mounted transformers of the dead-front 
and live-front types for exterior applications</SCP>.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Use pad-mounted transformers (properly protected with bayonet type, oil-immersed, expulsion fuses in series with 
oil-immersed, partial-range, current-limiting fuses) for kVA ratings up to and including 750 kVA on 5 kV systems 
and for kVA ratings up to and including 1500 kVA on 15 and 25 kV systems.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For voltages above 25 kV and in ratings above those previously indicated, this specification requires significant 
modifications and additional specification sections may need to be added on the project.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>The use of pad-mounted transformers with secondary currents exceeding 2000 amperes is discouraged due to the size 
and quantity of secondary conductors.  Therefore, transformers above 750 kVA serving 208Y/120 volt loads and transformers 
above 1500 kVA serving 480Y/277 volt loads should be in a secondary unit substation configuration.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>Contact the cognizant EFD or PWC for direction.</NPR><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<NPR>For NAVFAC SE projects, determine the use of secondary unit substations on a case by case basis.</NPR><BRK/>
