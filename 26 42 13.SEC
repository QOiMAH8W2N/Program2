<BRK/>
<TXT>It is convenient to classify corrosion by the forms in which it manifests itself, the basis for this classification being the appearance of the 
corroded metal. Each form can be identified by visual observation, although, in some cases, magnification is required.  Valuable information for 
the solution of a corrosion problem can often be obtained through careful observation of the corroded test specimens or failed equipment. Examination 
before cleaning is particularly desirable.  Cathodic Protection is a method used to control corrosion.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Cathodic Protection</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Cathodic Protection (CP) is an electrochemical (half electrical and half chemical) method used to control corrosion of buried or submerged metallic 
structures.  It prevents corrosion by making the protected structure a cathode by installing a more anodic metal (sacrificial or galvanic) anode 
or a metallic (impressed current) anode connected to a Direct Current (DC) power source. When the proper amount of current is applied to the structure, 
it becomes a cathode. Since all corrosion occurs at the anode, the structure no longer corrodes.  The electrons move in the metallic path (electrical). 
Reduction (chemical) reactions occur at the surface of the cathode resulting in a hydrogen coating and more alkaline environment. Oxidation (chemical) 
reactions occur at the surface of the anode resulting in corrosion and a more acidic environment.  After a CP system is installed and adjusted 
to provide adequate protection, the hydrogen coats the defects in the coating and polarizes in the negative direction (to a copper/copper sulfate 
reference electrode) over time the current and potentials remain relatively stable; changes in currents or potentials indicate a problem.  An error-free 
measurement of negative 850 millivolts DC or more negative to the copper/copper-sulfate reference electrode proves the structure is a cathode and 
corrosion has been mitigated.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>Corrosion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>It is convenient to classify corrosion by the forms in which it manifests itself, the basis for this classification being the appearance of the 
corroded metal.  Each form can be identified by visual observation, although, in some cases, magnification is required.  Valuable information for 
the solution of a corrosion problem can often be obtained through careful observation of the corroded test specimens or failed equipment.  Examination 
before cleaning is particularly desirable.  Some of the eight forms of corrosion are unique, but all of them are more or less interrelated.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>The eight forms of corrosion are: (1) Uniform Attack, (2) Galvanic or Two-Metal Corrosion, (3) Crevice Corrosion, (4) Pitting Corrosion, (5) Intergranular 
Corrosion, (6) Selective Leaching, (7) Erosion Corrosion, and (8) Stress Corrosion Cracking.  This listing is arbitrary but covers practically 
all corrosion failures and problems.  The forms are not listed in any particular order of importance.  Below, the eight forms of corrosion are 
discussed in terms of their characteristics, mechanisms, and preventive measures.  Hydrogen damage, although not a form of corrosion, often occurs 
indirectly as a result of corrosive attack and is, therefore, included in this discussion.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Alternating Current (AC) Corrosion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>AC corrosion occurs when there is a source of AC current, typically from a high voltage overhead AC (OHAC) power-line, when there is a low soil 
resistivity - typically less than 5,000 ohm-cm and there is a very small coating holidays.  The AC corrosion pits typically have a tubercle of 
corrosion product at the pit.  AC interference study modeling software can determine the mitigation solution to solve this problem. Typically, 
AC Corrosion mitigation is done in conjunction with high AC potentials and fault current mitigation.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>AC Interference</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>AC interference occurs when a pipeline parallels a high-voltage overhead AC (OHAC) power-line.  An interference study is required when this situation 
occurs as AC interference can cause high AC potentials along the pipeline (safety), can cause a fault condition between the pipeline and power-line 
and could cause AC corrosion to occur. The pipeline coating when exposed can have blisters/bubbles caused by the excessive AC.  The interference 
study will use modeling software to determine what combination of interference may be occurring (if any) and provide the mitigation solution to 
solve the problem.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Uniform Attack</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Uniform attack is the most common form of corrosion.  It is normally characterized by a chemical or electrochemical reaction that proceeds uniformly 
over the entire exposed surface or over a large area.  The metal becomes thinner and eventually fails.  For example, a piece of steel or zinc immersed 
in dilute sulfuric acid normally dissolves at a uniform rate over its entire surface.  A sheet iron roof shows essentially the same degree of rusting 
over its entire outside surface.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Uniform attack, or general overall corrosion, represents the greatest destruction of metal on a tonnage basis.  This form of corrosion, however, 
is not of great concern from a technical standpoint, because the life of equipment can be accurately estimated on the basis of comparatively simple 
tests.  Merely immersing specimens in the fluid involved is often sufficient.  Uniform attack can be prevented or reduced by (1) materials, such 
as coatings, that reduce contact between metal and electrolytes, (2) inhibitors, or (3) CP.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Galvanic or Two-Metal Corrosion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>A potential difference usually exists between two dissimilar-metals when they are immersed in a corrosive or conductive solution.  If these metals 
are placed in contact (or otherwise electrically connected), this potential difference produces electron flow between them.  Corrosion of the less 
corrosion-resistant metal is usually increased, and attack of the more resistant material is decreased, compared to the behavior of these metals 
when they are not in contact.  The less resistant metal becomes anodic and the more resistant metal becomes cathodic.  Usually the cathode or cathodic 
metal corrodes very little or not at all in this type of couple.  Because of the electric currents and dissimilar-metals involved, this form of 
corrosion is called galvanic, bi-metallic or two-metal, corrosion.  Galvanic corrosion is restricted to electrochemical corrosion caused by dissimilar-metal 
effects.  It is electrochemical corrosion, but this document must restrict the term galvanic to dissimilar-metal effects for purposes of clarity.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Crevice Corrosion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Intense localized corrosion frequently occurs within crevices and other shielded areas on metal surfaces exposed to corrosives.  This type of attack 
is usually associated with small volumes of stagnant solution caused by holes, gasket surfaces, lap joints, surface deposits, and crevices under 
bolt and rivet heads.  As a result, this form of corrosion is called crevice corrosion or, sometimes, deposit or gasket corrosion.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Pitting Corrosion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Pitting is a form of extremely localized attack that results in holes in the metal.  These holes may be small or large in diameter, but in most 
cases they are relatively small.  Pits are sometimes isolated or so close together that they look like a rough surface.  Generally a pit may be 
described as a cavity or hole with the surface diameter about the same as or less than the depth.  Pitting is one of the most destructive and insidious 
forms of corrosion.  It causes equipment to fail because of perforation with only a small percent weight loss of the entire structure.  It is often 
difficult to detect pits because of their small size and because the pits are often covered with corrosion products.  In addition, it is difficult 
to measure quantitatively and compare the extent of pitting because of the varying depths and numbers of pits that may occur under identical conditions.  
Pitting is also difficult to predict by laboratory tests.  Sometimes the pits require a long time (several months or a year) to show up in actual 
service.  Pitting is particularly vicious because it is a localized and intense form of corrosion, and failures often occur with extreme suddenness.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Intergranular Corrosion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Grain boundary effects are of little or no consequence in most applications or uses of metals.  If a metal corrodes, uniform attack results since 
grain boundaries are usually only slightly more reactive than the matrix.  However, under certain conditions, grain interfaces are very reactive 
and intergranular corrosion results.  Localized attack at and adjacent to grain boundaries, with relatively little corrosion of the grains, is 
intergranular corrosion.  The alloy disintegrates (grains fall out) or loses its strength.  Intergranular corrosion can be caused by impurities 
at the grain boundaries, enrichment of one of the alloying elements, or depletion of one of these elements in the grain-boundary areas.  Small 
amounts of iron in aluminum, wherein the solubility of iron is low, have been shown to segregate in the grain boundaries and cause intergranular 
corrosion.  It has been shown that, based on surface tension considerations, the zinc content of a brass is higher at the grain boundaries.  Depletion 
of chromium in the grain-boundary regions results in intergranular corrosion of stainless steels.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Selective Leaching</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Selective leaching is the removal of one element from a solid alloy by corrosion processes.  The most common example is the selective removal of 
zinc in brass alloys (dezincification).  Similar processes occur in other alloy systems in which aluminum, iron, cobalt, chromium, and other elements 
are removed.  Selective leaching is the general term to describe these processes, and its use precludes the creation of terms such as de-aluminumification, 
de-cobaltification.  Parting is a metallurgical term that is sometimes applied, but selective leaching is preferred.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Erosion Corrosion</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Erosion corrosion is the acceleration or increase in rate of deterioration or attack on a metal because of relative movement between a corrosive 
fluid and the metal surface.  Generally, this movement is quite rapid, and mechanical wear effects or abrasion are involved.  Metal is removed 
from the surface as dissolved ions, or it forms solid corrosion products, which are mechanically swept from the metal surface.  Sometimes, movement 
of the environment decreases corrosion, particularly when localized attack occurs under stagnant conditions; this is not erosion corrosion because 
deterioration is not increased.  Erosion corrosion is characterized in appearance by grooves, gullies, waves, rounded holes, and valleys and usually 
exhibits a directional pattern.  In many cases, failures because of erosion corrosion occur in a relatively short time, and they are unexpected 
largely because evaluation corrosion tests were run under static conditions or because the erosion effects were not considered.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Stress-Corrosion Cracking</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Stress-corrosion cracking refers to cracking caused by the simultaneous presence of tensile stress and a specific corrosive medium.  Many investigators 
have classified all cracking failures occurring in corrosive media as stress-corrosion cracking, including failures due to hydrogen embrittlement.  
However, these two types of cracking failures respond differently to environmental variables.  To illustrate, CP is an effective method for preventing 
stress-corrosion cracking; however, hydrogen-embrittlement may be caused when excessive current is applied, especially on stainless steel.  Hence, 
the importance of considering stress-corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement as separate phenomena is obvious.  During stress-corrosion cracking, 
the metal or alloy is virtually unattacked over most of its surface, while fine cracks progress through it.  This cracking phenomenon has serious 
consequences, since it can occur at stresses within the range of typical design stress.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/></SPT>
<SPT><TTL>Exothermic Welding</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>Exothermic welding is used in CP to connect a copper wire to a metallic structure, usually steel or cast-iron.  It is a pyrotechnic composition 
of copper oxide, aluminum powder and magnesium powder.  The magnesium powder is ignited with a spark gun or electronic ignition equipment.  The 
aluminum powder serves as fuel, and melts the copper oxide, which bonds the wire to the structure.  Although not explosive, it can create brief 
bursts of heat and high temperature in a small area.</TXT><BRK/>

<SPT><TTL>SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<SPT><TTL>Corrosion Control System Description</TTL><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<TXT>A corrosion control system consists of several systems which work together to mitigate corrosion on buried or submerged metallic structures.  Failure 
to comply with the requirements of any one of these systems may result in inadequate corrosion control and premature failure of the structure being 
protected.  Each system's guide specifications must be included in the design and installation of a complete corrosion control system and must 
be adhered to in the design and execution of the corrosion control of a structure being protected.  Determination of Need for CP must be made by 
government requirements and policy directives.</TXT><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">a.  Construction Design Requirements (CDR) for protected structures are found in the UFGS for the structure being protected.  For water 
storage tanks refer to Section <SRF>33 16 15</SRF> WATER STORAGE STEEL TANKS, <RID>NACE SP0388</RID>, and <RID>NACE SP0196</RID>, underground storage tanks <RID>NACE SP0285</RID>, 
aboveground storage <RID>NACE SP0193</RID>, fuel storage piping Section <SRF>33 52 40</SRF> FUEL SYSTEMS PIPING (NON-HYDRANT), aviation fuel piping Section 
<SRF>33 52 43.13</SRF> AVIATION FUEL PIPING, leak detection systems Section <SRF>33 01 50.31</SRF> LEAK DETECTION FOR FUELING SYSTEMS, offshore pipelines <RID>NACE SP0607</RID>
 and <RID>ISO 15589-2</RID>, offshore structures and <RID>NACE SP0176</RID>, pipeline casings structures (railroad, highway and water crossing) <RID>NACE SP0200</RID> and 
for well casings <RID>NACE SP0186</RID>.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">b.  Coating Systems (CS) are a critical factor in performance of a GACP system.  All coatings, including coatings in structure guide specifications 
and Green Seal (GS) coatings, must be compatible with the structure and the CP system, and have high disbondment capabilities.  A high 
resistance to cathodic disbondment is critical for long term service life of coatings on buried or submerged metallic structures under 
CP.  For paints and coatings refer to Section <SRF>09 90 00</SRF> PAINTS AND COATINGS, and for discontinuity (Holiday) testing of new protective coatings 
on conductive substrates refer to <RID>NACE SP0188</RID>.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">c.  Mechanical Damage Systems (MDS) such as bedding and rock control barriers normally included in Structure GS may be required by design 
for some locations.  Electrical Isolation is required for all galvanic anode CP systems.  For an Electrical Isolation System (EIS) refer 
to <RID>NACE SP0286</RID>.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">d.  An Electrical Continuity System (ECS) of the protected structure is critical to the operation of the CP system.  The types of joints 
such as bonding and couplings are normally included in Structure GS, this is particularly important to nonwelded pipelines to allow sufficient 
CP current to conduct to the entire structure.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">e.  Stray Current (Interference) Systems must be considered in design, monitored during construction, and interference testing must be 
completed during the final testing.  Design must consider all other cathodic protection systems which may affect other systems or systems 
which may affect the project, including foreign systems. All foreign systems must be contacted for information and notification and any 
joint testing which may be required. Corrosion Coordinating Committees may exist. Reference <RID>NACE TPC 11</RID>.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">f.  Pipelines that parallel overhead high voltage AC transmission power systems are subject to induced AC.  Induced AC has several potential 
adverse impacts on the safety of personnel and pipeline integrity.  Assuming that these conditions exist, there are several measures that 
can be taken to mitigate the induced AC present on a pipeline.  These induced AC mitigation strategies are detailed in various international 
standards including <RID>NACE SP0177</RID>.</LST><BRK/>
<NTE><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/>
<NPR>NOTE:  Any AC test voltage over 15 AC must be mitigated.</NPR><BRK/>
<AST/><BRK/></NTE>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">g.  Galvanic Anode CP Monitoring System is a solution for remote monitoring (and optionally controlling) different kinds of galvanic anode 
CP applications, mainly to protect underground pipelines used in oil and gas distribution systems, but the same system can be used to monitor 
other galvanic anode CP applications like tank farms and oil platforms.  These Monitoring Systems are detailed in various international 
standards including <RID>NACE TPC 11</RID>.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">h.  When a project is connecting to an existing infrastructure with CP the design must be compatible with the existing structure(s) CP 
system.  Existing structures may have Impressed Current CP (ICCP) Anode Systems using Remote Anode Systems, Deep Anode Systems, Linear 
Anode Systems, or Distributed Anode Systems.  Existing structures may also have Galvanic CP (GACP) Systems which may be distributed or 
remote.  Existing structures might not have CP.  They may use alternative methods of corrosion mitigation instead of CP such as Inhibitor 
System/Internal Corrosion Control.  For control of internal corrosion in steel pipelines and piping systems refer to <RID>NACE SP0106</RID>.  Due 
to the limited voltage and current of galvanic anodes the protected structure must be coated and isolated from other structures.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">i.  A highly dielectric bonded coating is required to attain adequate CP.  Unbonded coatings block the protective current from the pipeline 
or structure and must not be used with CP.  Failure to isolate other metallic structures will result in loss of protection.  Isolation 
from other metallic structures must be maintained.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">j.  Continuity of the structure with low resistance is crucial to proper operation of a galvanic anode system.  All joints must be continuous 
or be bonded to both sides of the joint.</LST><BRK/>
<BRK/>
<LST INDENT="-0.33">k.  A conductive electrolyte is required to allow current flow from the galvanic anodes.  Use of galvanic anode systems are normally restricted 
to electrolytes with resistivities below 30,000 ohm-cm.  Small well coated structures such as coated valves, tees and elbows have very 
high resistance to earth in high resistance soils.  Galvanic anodes in electrolytes over 30,000 ohms also have very high resistance to 
earth.  High circuit resistance with the low voltage of galvanic anodes will not allow sufficient current to meet instant off or depolarization 
criteria.  Additional anodes under these conditions will not noticeably increase the current applied to the structure.  Reference SP0169 
for criteria in high resistance electrolytes.</LST><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  Galvanic anodes are not recommended for use in soil resistivities greater than 30,000 ohm-cm. When galvanic 
anodes are used to protect well coated metallic components such as isolated valves, hydrants, and other isolated 
pipe fittings in exceptionally high soil resistivities the circuit resistance to earth of the fitting will be 
in the hundreds or easily over a thousand ohms. The 0.9 driving voltage of the galvanic anode does not provide 
sufficient current to meet any criteria for protection, especially considering the anode resistance to earth may 
be well over 400 ohms. Pipelines and tanks have virtually no resistance to earth, even in high soil resistivities. 
If galvanic anodes are used for this application, (especially in soil resistivities over 100,000 ohm-cm), galvanic 
anode output current is virtually zero. Adding additional anodes does not increase the amount of current. The 
corrosion rate in this environment is low over 30,000 ohm-cm and non-corrosive over 100,000 ohm-cm. If Potentials 
are taken, they must be taken with the reference electrode as remote as possible to the anode, and as near to 
the metallic component as possible. On potentials at or more negative than negative 850 mV indicates the Anode 
is dominate in the circuit and the extremely low corrosion is on the anode. This must be determined by the contractor's 
corrosion engineer and approved by the government.</NPR><BRK/>

<NPR>NOTE:  The CP system will fail unless full engineering considerations are applied to selection, location and installation 
of electrically conductive joints and electrically isolating joints including the use of underground type dielectric 
coatings (not paint).  Adequate electrical conductivity of a pipe joint made by means other than welding must 
be determined by a "corrosion expert." The "corrosion expert" must be accredited or certified by the National 
Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) as a NACE Accredited Corrosion Specialist or a NACE certified CP Specialist 
or be a registered professional engineer who has certification or licensing that includes education and experience 
in corrosion control.  Allowable electrical resistance depends on the cross sectional area of the pipe metal, 
the resistivity of the pipe metal, and the effectiveness of the coating on the pipe.  Effectively coated pipe 
underground requires only a fraction of the electrical conductivity at joints needed for bare (uncoated) pipe.  
Shop painted pipe is considered to be the same as bare (uncoated) pipe and is not to be confused with pipe coated 
with an underground type dielectric coating.  <BRK/>
The type of electrical isolating pipe joint to be used requires engineering design consideration.  In general, 
the dielectric parts of an isolating joint will not withstand structural or environmental stresses as well as 
an all-metal type of joint.  If the pipe on the cathodically protected side of the underground electrically isolating 
pipe joint, including the joint, is not effectively coated, interference type corrosion may occur unless other 
measures are taken.  Factors to be considered include:</NPR><BRK/>

must be based on a study of the conditions.  If the new piping is a short extension to an existing old piping
